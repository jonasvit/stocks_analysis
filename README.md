# Strategies for stocks

## Overview

The aim of this project was to create strategies for stocks to get best scenarios when to invest and when to take out the money. As this is the first time dealing with such data, strategies that was considered was **exponential moving average (EMA)**. It is one of the most basic strategies to implement, thus the results are not the best to expect to get. A moving average (MA) is a widely used technical indicator that smooths out price trends by filtering out the noise from random short-term price fluctuations. It is important to note that moving average strategy is mostly beneficial for short-term time series and the ones that do not have drastic increases/decreases over the time. In the results you will see that this method is nothing to compare to total returns for some instruments.

## Data set

Since dataset is quite large, there is just a sample data in input folder. In the future there is going to be a change in the code so that real data from Yahoo could be downloaded.
